      <p3
        >What do I want to do after school? Well, it is a question I think about from time to time, and I think honestly I want to work in a computer related company or job. All this coding I have been doin grecently is fun and something I can see myself doing in the future. I am also very interested in my fathers job. He is a SE at a software company called Salesforce. He travels alot selling Salesforce to some of the biggest countries in the world. So something along those lines.
