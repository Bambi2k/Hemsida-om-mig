        >My name is Alexander Erik Luan Holmgren. I was born on the 29th of July
        2004 at "Karolinksa sjukhuset" around 7:00 in the morning. I was a child
        of mixed backrounds. Mom with german and swedish roots, and a dad that
        is 100% albanian. I spent my first few years in Solna until i moved to
        Germany in 2010. I stayed there for 2 years until my dad was offered a
        job again back in sweden. Since then I have lived in Solna again,
        Vallentuna and now, Ellapark Täby. I live with my mom and dad, Enri and
        Petra, a sister named Fiona and two cats called Moe and Wall-e (named
        after charachters from popular pixar movie, Wall-e). I attend Åva
        gymmnasium studying Technology and well, that is why i am making this
        very website:>
