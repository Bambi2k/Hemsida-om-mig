      <h3>Hobbies and free time</h3>
      <p3
        >So with what do I keep myself busy when im not in school? Well, as a
        first I play basketball 4 times a week for the local team Norrort. As of
        writing this i actually have my first match in over a year to play in
        one day. Other than sports I am an avid video game player. Alot of
        League of Legends and "osu!", occasionally some Dead by Daylight aswell.
        Have been playing video games since a young age and actually built the
        very computer I use to play on. I occasionally like to do Sudokus and
        read a book now and then, and last but not last i like to hang out with
        my friends and girlfriend.
